# Privacy Policy for RoleMail

RoleMail is a Chrome extension that helps users create, save, and reuse email templates within Gmail.

## Data Collection
RoleMail does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data on external servers.

All email templates and related data are stored locally in the user’s browser using Chrome’s storage API.

## Data Usage
The extension accesses the active Gmail tab only when the user explicitly clicks the “Paste to Gmail” action, in order to insert the selected email template into the Gmail compose window.

## Third-Party Sharing
RoleMail does not share any data with third parties.

## Remote Code
RoleMail does not load or execute any remote code. All functionality is implemented using locally packaged files.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes in the future.
